## Features

- âœ… Safe Rust bindings for Windows debugging interfaces.
- âœ… Easy-to-use macros for logging to the debugger.
- âœ… Abstractions for managing symbols, memory, and CPU registers.
- âœ… Works seamlessly with the Windows COM-based debugging system.

## Installation

Add `dbg` to your project by updating your `Cargo.toml`:
```bash
cargo add dbg-rs
```

## Usage

The `dbg-rs` library provides utilities to interact with the Windows debugging engine, such as executing commands, logging messages, and inspecting debug symbols. Below are some common use cases:

### Logging to the Debugger

Use the `dprintln!` macro to send formatted messages to the debugger output:

```rs
use dbg_rs::dprintln;

// Example usage
dprintln!(dbg, "Hello, {}!", "Debugger");
dprintln!(dbg, "Number: {}", 42);
```

### Executing Commands

Running commands in the debugger:

```rs
use dbg_rs::Dbg;

dbg.exec(".echo Hello, Debugger!")?;
```

### Reading Virtual Memory

Access specific regions of the debugged process's memory:

```rs
use dbg_rs::Dbg;

let mut buffer = vec![0u8; 128];
dbg.read_vaddr(0x7FFEBEEF0000, &mut buffer)?;
println!("Read memory: {:?}", &buffer[..16]); // Print first 16 bytes
```
